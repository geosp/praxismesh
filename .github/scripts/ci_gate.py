"""Decide the result of the required `ci-ok` check from the `needs` context.

Run by the `ci-ok` job in .github/workflows/ci.yml with NEEDS (the JSON of the
`needs` context), EVENT (`github.event_name`) and REF (`github.ref`).

Every job in REQUIRED_JOBS must have succeeded. A skipped job is a failure, with
one exception: `licenses` (dependency review) runs only on pull requests, so it
may be skipped for runs on `main` itself, whose commits all arrived through a
pull request that already ran it.

tests/test_ci_gate.py checks that REQUIRED_JOBS matches the `needs` list of
`ci-ok`, so removing a job from the gate takes an edit here as well.
